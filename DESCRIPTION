Description: `ezLVAR` aids researchers in implementing the Three-Step
    Latent Vector Autoregression method. In the first step, the
    measurement model ist estimated. In the second step, factor scores and
    their reliability are computed. In the third step, the parameters of
    the structural model are estimated, using the factor scores as
    observed data while accounting for their inherent uncertainty.
