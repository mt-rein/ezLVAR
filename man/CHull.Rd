\title{Convex hull model selection for mixture Step 3 models}
\usage{
CHull(model_list, criterion = "logLik")
}
\arguments{
\item{model_list}{A list of objects obtained with the \code{step3()} function.}

\item{criterion}{Character string indicating which model fit index to use.
Must be one of \code{"logLik"}, \code{"AIC"}, \code{"AIC3"},
\code{"BIC"}, or \code{"ICL"}.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\item{df_all}{A data frame of all models with fit values and merged scree-test values.}
\item{df_hull}{A data frame with the models on the convex hull and their scree-test values.}
\item{criterion}{The fit criterion used.}
}
\description{
This function performs model selection using the convex hull approach.
Models with increasing complexity (number of clusters) are compared based on
the log likelihood or a specified information criterion, and only models lying
on the convex hull of the fit-versus-complexity curve are retained. Scree-test
values are computed for the models on the hull, and the model with the highest
scree-test value is selected as the optimal model.
